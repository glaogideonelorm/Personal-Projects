- Concerning Penetration testing project , it was a black box test on an OWASP-BWA to find and exploit vulnerabilites

- The file in this repository contains a detailed documentation **of all findings in a step by step procedure**

- This lead to the retrieval of sensitive data concerning the mock bank and gaining administrative priviledges to the system

- I was also able to retrieve credentials of the all empployees and people associated with the bank as well as editing them

- Concerning my work in Digital Foresics ,a mock case was investigated on where an employee was suspected of intentionally compromising the CIA of his employers

- I made use of several forensics tools such as FTK and autopsy to extract information on the system. I was also able to find deleted files which served as evidence against the suspect
